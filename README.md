# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

In this challenge, I built a coding quiz using web APIs. I designed a quiz with JavaScript that begins when you click the start button. When you answer a question incorrectly, time is taken off of the countdown. When the questions are over OR the clock hits zero, the game ends. You can then save your initials and your score on the high score board. I refactored the code to make it easier to read and follow along and pushed my code into my repository.
